# sc-inline-visual.nvim

Live, inline visualizations for SuperCollider code in Neovim — amplitude
braille meters, frequency-position bars with note names, and envelope
line-plots rendered as virtual text right next to the block that produced them.

> **Status:** experimental. Tested on macOS with `scsynth` + JACK; API and
> rendering details may change.

## Requirements

- Neovim **≥ 0.10** (uses `vim.uv`)
- [scnvim](https://github.com/davidgranstrom/scnvim) running in the same Neovim
  session (the plugin sends SC code through scnvim's sclang bridge)
- [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) with the
  `supercollider` parser installed (`:TSInstall supercollider`) — the buffer
  scanner is tree-sitter based
- SuperCollider (`scsynth` + `sclang`) on `$PATH`

## Install

With [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "mixify/sc-inline-visual.nvim",
  ft = "supercollider",
  dependencies = {
    "davidgranstrom/scnvim",
    "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
  },
  opts = {
    -- defaults, all optional
    port                  = 57121,  -- UDP port shared between Neovim and SC
    render_fps            = 30,     -- redraw + SC analysis SendReply rate
    auto_start            = true,   -- start on first .scd buffer
    notify                = true,   -- vim.notify on start / stop
    idle_gc_seconds       = 60,     -- free silent block buses after this idle period (0 = off)
    idle_gc_check_seconds = 5,      -- GC sweep interval
    pattern_view          = "future", -- "future" timeline | "history" grid | "both"
    pattern_preview_count = 16,     -- events pulled per eval for the future timeline
  },
}
```

Then run `:TSInstall supercollider` once to fetch the parser.

The plugin loads on `.scd` filetype and auto-starts after scnvim's sclang
process is up (polls for ~60s, then gives up silently). Set `auto_start = false`
to drive it manually with `:SCInlineVisualStart`.

## Usage

Open any `.scd` file with scnvim running, then evaluate a block (default
scnvim keymap: `<C-e>` on a `( ... )` block). The plugin will:

1. Parse the buffer for evaluatable blocks (`( ... )`, explicit `Ndef`/`Pdef`,
   single-line `{ ... }.play`, or any block tagged with `// @vis <name>`).
2. Rewrite any `<expr>.play` chain so audio is routed through a per-block bus:
   - `{ body }.play` becomes `~scvisWrap.value("block_n", { body }).play`
     (Function dispatch: wraps the body in `Out.ar(bus, ...)`).
   - `Pbind(...).play` and `Pdef(\name, Pbind(...)).play` get the same
     treatment via the Pattern dispatch path
     (`Pbindf(<pattern>, \out, bus)`), so each Pbind streams to its own bus
     and visualizes independently instead of all blending into the master
     readout.
3. Attach an FFT/amplitude monitor synth per block on the SC server.
4. Render virtual-text widgets above each block at ~30 FPS:
   - **amp braille meter** (left-to-right intensity)
   - **frequency position bar** with the dominant note name (e.g. `A4`, `G#5`)
   - **envelope line-plot** for any `EnvGen.kr(Env.new(...))` it can statically
     read out of the block source, with axis readouts — peak level (`↑`) on the
     top row (y) and the total duration (`0–<t>`) on the bottom (x):

     ```
     env  ⢰⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀  perc ↑1
          ⢸⣿⣿⣦⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
        0 ⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣦⣤⣤⣀⣀⣀⡀⠀  0–1.21s
     ```

     **Curves are honored** — segment curvature follows SC's own `Env` shapes, so
     `perc`/`adsr` show their real convex exponential decay (default curve `-4`),
     not a straight line. Numeric curves, the named curves (`\lin`, `\exp`,
     `\sin`, `\wel`, `\step`, `\hold`), and `Env.new`'s per-segment curve array
     all map through.
   - **pattern future timeline** for `Pbind`/`Pbindef` blocks (default): when
     you evaluate the block, SC pulls the next N events from an *independent*
     stream (`/scvis/pat_preview`) and the widget lays them out left→right as a
     forward grid with a cumulative-time axis and one row per key you wrote —
     so you can read the shape of the next bars *before* hearing them:

     ```
     ▸ next ╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌▶
     t     0    .25  .375 .5   .75
     degr  C    D    E    D    C
     amp   ▁    ▃    ▅    ▂    ▇
     dur   0.25 0.12 0.12 0.5  0.25
     ```

     Because the preview stream is independent of the one that plays, stochastic
     patterns (Pwrand, Pbrown, Prand, …) show their *character* — representative
     of the next bars, not their exact future. Set `pattern_view` to `"history"`
     for the original last-N-played grid (most recent on the right in hot
     colour, rendered from `/scvis/pat_event`), or `"both"` to stack them.

     Put the cursor on a key's value expression (e.g. on the `Pseq(...)` after
     `\degree`) and that row's label lights up with a `▸` marker — so in a dense
     `Pbind` you can see at a glance which row the expression under your cursor
     drives.
   - **LFO/Noise inline sparkline** for control-rate UGen expressions: a
     *static* simulation of the signal's shape over time, drawn at the end of
     the line — visible without evaluating, no server round-trip:

     ```
     var cutoff = LFNoise1.kr(0.3).exprange(300, 3000);  ▂▂▃▃▂▂▁▂▂▃▄▅▆▇█  0.3Hz 300–3k
     var lfo    = SinOsc.kr(2).range(200, 800);          ▅██▅▁▁▄██▅▁▁▄██▅  2Hz 200–800
     var sweep  = XLine.kr(2000, 200, 1);                ███▆▅▄▃▂▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁  XLine 2k↘200
     ```

     The shape is exact for deterministic UGens (SinOsc, LFSaw, LFPulse, …) and
     a stable, seeded sample for the noise family (LFNoise{0,1,2}, Pink/Brown,
     Dust, …) — so you read *character* (stepped vs ramp vs smooth) and the
     frequency / range from the label. `.exprange`/`.linexp` warp the trace the
     way the audible parameter actually moves. **`Line.kr`/`XLine.kr`** one-shot
     ramps are drawn too — direction-aware (`↗`/`↘`) with `XLine` showing its
     exponential curve, labelled `start↗end`. Only control rate (`.kr`) is
     sparklined — `.ar` is the audible signal, not a slow control variable. Set
     `lfo_sparkline = false` to disable.
   - **Keyboard slider** — put the cursor on any number and nudge it with
     `<C-Up>`/`<C-Down>` (`<C-S-Up>`/`<C-S-Down>` for ×10; prefix a count for a
     bigger jump). The step is sized to the literal's own precision (`440`→±1,
     `0.25`→±0.01) and the buffer text rewrites in place. When the number is a
     live-settable control — an Ndef NamedControl default (`\freq.kr(440)`) or a
     Pbindef key value (`\dur, 0.25`) — it's pushed to SC with a glitch-free
     `.set`/`Pbindef` update, so you *hear* it move with no recompile while the
     inline sparkline / readouts update with it. Other numbers still edit the
     text (a later eval applies them). See [Keyboard slider](#keyboard-slider).

## Keyboard slider

Scrub the number under the cursor and hear it change live. Default keys (mapped
buffer-locally in `supercollider` buffers):

| Key                          | Action                                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `<C-Up>` / `<C-Down>`        | Step the literal ±1 of its last digit.  |
| `<C-S-Up>` / `<C-S-Down>`    | Step ×10.                               |
| `{count}<C-Up>`              | Step `{count}` times (e.g. `20<C-Up>`). |

Configure (or disable) the keys via `config.scrub`; set any field to `""` to
leave it unmapped and bind the `<Plug>` maps yourself:

```lua
opts = {
  scrub = {
    enabled  = true,
    up       = "<C-Up>",   down      = "<C-Down>",
    big_up   = "<C-S-Up>", big_down  = "<C-S-Down>",
  },
}
-- or your own bindings:
vim.keymap.set("n", "<A-k>", "<Plug>(ScInlineVisualScrubUp)",   { remap = true })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<A-j>", "<Plug>(ScInlineVisualScrubDown)", { remap = true })
```

The glitch-free live update covers three settable forms:

- **Ndef NamedControl defaults** — `\freq.kr(440)` → `Ndef(\name).set(\freq, …)`
- **Pbindef key scalars** — `\dur, 0.25` → `Pbindef(\name, \dur, …)`
- **Synth-function arg defaults bound to a var** — `x = { |freq = 220| … }.play`
  → `x.set(\freq, …)` (also `arg freq = 220;` form). The handle is the variable
  the function is assigned to (a `~name` or an interpreter `a`–`z`), so a bare
  `{ … }.play` with nowhere to `.set` stays text-only. The arg survives the
  visualization wrap because `SynthDef.wrap` keeps it a control.

Any other number still scrubs the buffer text — a later eval applies it — but
isn't pushed live (no surprise synth rebuilds).

When the control name is a standard SuperCollider **ControlSpec** (`\freq`,
`\amp`, `\pan`, `\rq`, `\detune`, `\rate`, …) the step is **clamped to that
spec's range** — scrubbing `\amp` won't pass 1.0 or go negative, `\freq` stays
within 20–20000. Stepping itself stays linear at the literal's own precision
(so the buffer keeps clean numbers); the spec only bounds it. Unrecognised names
scrub freely with no range.

### Slider readout

Those same spec-backed controls also get an inline **slider** drawn at the end
of the block — the handle is the literal in the buffer, so it slides the instant
you scrub:

```
freq    440  20 ━━━━━●━━━━━━━ 20k
amp    0.10  0 ━●━━━━━━━━━━━ 1
```

The endpoints are the spec's min/max and the handle is positioned with the
spec's warp (so `\freq` reads logarithmically, the way the ear hears it). Only
controls with a known ControlSpec get a slider; everything else keeps its plain
readout. Set `sliders = false` to disable.

## How it works

A small SuperCollider script (`sc/monitor.scd`) installs:

- One persistent amp+centroid monitor synth on the master bus.
- `~scvisEnsureBus` — allocates (and caches) the per-block bus / router /
  monitor trio. The router pipes the bus to `out 0` so the user still hears
  it; the monitor runs FFT + Amplitude analysis and reports at `render_fps`.
- `~scvisWrap` — polymorphic decorator. Dispatches on the runtime type of
  the wrapped expression:
  - `Function` → returns `{ Out.ar(bus, SynthDef.wrap(body)) }` (transient
    synth per call, freed by `doneAction` in user UGens).
  - `Pattern`  → returns `Pchain(Pbindf(pattern, \out, bus), Pbind(\callback, fn))`
    so each scheduled Event writes to the block's bus AND fires `fn` once
    its keys are resolved. `fn` sends `/scvis/pat_event` with the actual
    values (`midinote`, `degree`, `freq`, `dur`, `amp`) — the widget reads
    them out of the sliding history, so the displayed values match what
    SC actually scheduled even for stochastic patterns.
  - `Event`    → mutates the Event in place (`put(\out, bus)`) and returns
    it; covers the common `(instrument: \name, ...).play` idiom. The
    Pattern and Event clauses both silently override any user-supplied
    `\out` — set it elsewhere if you really need a custom output.
- `~scvisTrackNdef` — alternate path for explicit `Ndef`s, which have their
  own bus on the NodeProxy side; the helper just attaches a monitor synth.

Both monitors emit `SendReply` packets at 30 Hz over OSC (`127.0.0.1:57121`)
that the Neovim side parses and stores per target. A render timer reads that
state and updates extmarks.

`Cmd-.` (or `s.freeAll`) is handled — buses are freed and the monitor
re-installed automatically.

## Marking custom blocks

Add `// @vis <name>` above any region you want tracked under a stable name:

```supercollider
// @vis lead
(
SynthDef(\lead, { |freq = 440| Out.ar(0, SinOsc.ar(freq) * 0.2 ! 2) }).add;
)
```

## Limitations

- A long live-coding session that evaluates many distinct block names will
  accumulate per-block buses; the idle GC (default 60 s, configurable) frees
  them once their monitor has gone silent. The next `.play` on that block
  re-allocates.
- The envelope renderer reads `Env.new([...], [...])` literals — runtime
  values built by Lua-ish expressions don't render.
- The buffer scanner is tree-sitter based, so the `supercollider` parser must
  be installed. Without it the plugin still loads but no blocks are detected.
- Tested with the macOS `scsynth` build over JACK. Other platforms should work
  but are unverified.

## Development

The plugin's SC side lives in `sc/monitor.scd` (install) and
`sc/monitor_free.scd` (teardown); the Lua side loads them with
`vim.fn.readfile`. Edit those files directly when iterating on SC behaviour.

Run the smoke test suite (pure-Lua + UDP loopback, no sclang required):

```sh
bash test/smoke_test.sh
```

The tree-sitter parser tests skip by default. To exercise them locally, build
the SC grammar once and point the test at the resulting `.so`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/tree-sitter-supercollider /tmp/ts-sc
cc -o /tmp/ts-sc/supercollider.so -shared -fPIC -I /tmp/ts-sc/src \
   /tmp/ts-sc/src/parser.c /tmp/ts-sc/src/scanner.c
SC_TS_PARSER_PATH=/tmp/ts-sc/supercollider.so bash test/smoke_test.sh
```
